# CHIP-8

## Overview

This is an implementation of the CHIP-8 interpreter using Go.

> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker on his 1802 microprocessor.  
> It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800, which were 8-bit microcomputers made in the mid-1970s.<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>
